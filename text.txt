Memes everywhere 
 Memebers in my youtube 
Love this nepali comment
Love from tulsipur 
The Nepali Comment   In Depth Story            
IDS is biased af I even doubt he is getting a payday by corporations
Same as me
Kommon Nepal beyond sagarmatha
 yo channel ni baised ho
 Legends trust Only Tanka Dahal   
 why so 
In Depth Story is biased
malai indept story yesto chor channel laghxa personally tyo resham chaudary ko video here paxi
 ho indept story chai ho brainwash garna ma mahir xan tara


I think the course is pack of information on a topic but today you can get anything onli  If you really wanna grow on YouTube I woul like to recommend the best YouTube channels like       And Try To Watch Podcasts of Creators like Mrbeast Ryan TrahanColin And SamirMkbhdThugeshEtc YouTube is a Long Long Long Journey Just Keep Grinding 
Bro started his downfall
Please Mali ne support garnuna
I dont like in depth story
Popularity corrupts
I am too a content creator 
Best Both Creators  
Now here you get unsubscribe 
I wasnt expecting this from you TNC Well about IDS his videos and the things he used to do were biased in themselves so I wasnt really surprised to see him doing this But you TNC Im disappointed
unsubcribe garna man lagni video post vayo tw dai aru video tw ramro hunthiyo
Eta Pani course suru vayo  YouTubers haru YouTuber Kaam course creator jyada vaye 
You guyz did a lot of research for your content but yo content ko lagi i dont think suitable hola ani you were talking about you will be teaching what viewer want to see but failed to know what your own vewers wants to watch  Tapai haru great researcher ho ani i think its too early to this
Not hating but get ready for down fall in yt carrer
First revive your channel See the views of this video
lamo mug haru aafno video ma million views kateko chaina vudeo banauna sikaune re I unsubscribed these fools
I think you guys needs  million plus subs to make these types of course In my opinion its too early to share your experience until you reach to that level
Kailash Siwal CEO of Kantipur Media Most Power Full Person of Nepal plz yesko bari ma Video banauna paryo Sir
Kailash Siwal CEO of Kantipur Media Most Power Full Person of Nepal plz yesko bari ma Video banauna paryo Sir
Kailash Siwal CEO of Kantipur Media Most Power Full Person of Nepal plz yesko bari ma Video banauna paryo Sir
    
Ab ghode ke race me gadhe bhi dhaudenge
ramro janakari video
Both of your combined followers arent even kI respect you guys for good research and above average content but take your own  channel to next level first and teach people about your experiences later
I knew Ids ta yestai manche ho manipulative video haru post grni but dipesh dai bata chai yo aas thiyena malai ids le hajur lai bigare cha
Sathi haru ko youtube yatra yehi samma raixa
Editing ko course banauna partyo ksm yeti appreciation pautheu hola brother but yo yt course is not beneficial at all 

Cause k garni k

Yt course le k garni

Baru from scratch to advance level editing like you guys do documentary style editing that could help Neplese audience to learn video editing 

Ani foreign client lai kam garera huntyo ki nepal kai client ko lagi kam garera huntyo they would earn 

Ani baru price halka high gareni kei huntheyna cause 

Video editing rmrri sikyo vaney rmro portfolio banayo vaney client paunu  nai cha

But YouTube is uncertain and many Nepalese people timi haruko video herni doesnt Want to start a channel by themselves 

Cause these all things are saturated but video editing would never get saturated and never will as well

Whatever you say is one of the part of the story but I like your content brother others contents are good but the contents you provide are authentic and genuinely relatable with the viewers no comparisons with others
To learn YouTube you can find courses training and videos easily on the platform itself So I dont think you have to buy anything if you truly want to pursue YouTube

People in Nepal dont know where to spend money
They will waste k anywhere else than buying courses and attending seminars for their personal growth
Im not claiming that this course is value for money but the point is that why should we criticise them Are they stealing your money Are they selling fake hopes 
They are selling their talent and experience and nothing is wrong with that in my opinion
lol that means 
you shouldve supported Vivek Bindra back in the time of controversy
 Vivek was selling fake hopes but they arent claiming any extra ordinary things
You cant compare  fake MBA titled course with this course
But always its your own perception and I respect that
Becoming a YouTuber You dont need to buy any of course Just ask CHAT GPT I dont think selling a course on how to youtube will be sold  Nepali Comment Rather try to make course on something different like using chat gpt Nothing wrong selling this course but i think this is not a good idea  for first course Should have tried different different concept IN depth story i dont like that guy Videos based on assumptions more than facts
Kamau kamau kta ho comment garne sab kei garna nasakne haru What you think right is actually right Ignore every other thing

Ma hazur sanaga personally contact garera  video YouTube ma Halna chahanxu
For months you guys were my two of my favorite YouTubers from Nepal today you lost it Selling YouTube course Xya
You guys couldve made a collab video about how to be successful on YouTube describing youtubes algorithm and many more tips
There are lots of videos on YouTube which are available for free thatll teach people how to do YouTube YouTubes algorithm is weird and it differs through time
Aile Nepal ma jasto type ko videos Nepali harulai manpardeixa alik samaye ma manparna xodxa Just like how paila paila chalne videos haru aile kunei youtuber harule banayo vane chaldeina Look at daily vlogs ek jamana ma wild chaleko ho aile views consistent xaina Ek jamana ma PUBG gaming wild chaleko ho aile xaina Why Because peoples interest keeps on changing Ani YouTubes algorithm is all about watch time Ani how to get more watch time Audience Retention high hunu paryo tyo retention ma kaam garna gaaro xa Manxe ko interest jamayera rakhna gaaro xa Kunei manxe le sikayera sikne kura haina yo YouTube algorithm vanne kuro YouTube is all about self growth and experiences The more you do the more experience you have the more youll learn the more youll know about YouTube

You guys couldve made a video about YouTube and its algorithm selling course wasnt pachauna sakne kura for me
Its similar to Andrew Tate selling Hustlers University courses and I hate that
I aint reading all that
Sab kura youtube ma free ma sikinxa bhanya why we need to buy your course

Oh my god i cannot even imagine
Eagerly waiting 
Looking at all the comments it is quite evident that we Nepali are very quick to negate everything and bad mouth about others
What bad mouth you know and I know this is a pathetic attempt to make money  What do you want to learn anyway They arent even right channel to learn it They barely Cross k subscription even with both combined
sucvï¿½ You are absolutely right
I thought something big Khulasa or huge content when I heard BIG COLLABORATION only to be disappointed by Cash Garb course
Everything is free on YouTube Please Research on YouTube Rather the purchasing Courses 
Please dont buy these coursesNobody till know has became successful after  buying these course
The collaboration we needed
It is business 
Nice Good to know may both has a successful update working together m
Reseach garna tanka dahal bata sikau ho chapri youtubers
lol I dont think its time yet to be teachers guys people will watch you for who you are I feel like this course is BS Dont be diverted
Katro hatar ho paisa kamauna 
I dont think this is a smart move 

Maybe you two might have done collaboration in something else

There exist no goodwill of online course selling

If you want to become a successful content creator you wouldnt even consider buying this course Even with just a bit of research youll discover that theyre merely selling superficial knowledge coated with their own fame The trend of Selling Dreams as Courses isnt anything new and its expected from these socalled articlereading extremists However they know for a fact that Nepali people will still buy it because they worship content creators
Bro your comment is going to be deleted
 If they have got guts then they will reply to it but you know its a scam if they delete it
True shit man I appreciate that 
Fax
It would have been useless if the cost was very high I dont think it would be waste of money as they are not charging exorbitantly Though caveat to this is price is too low
 yup
They arent charging which might make people broke So its probably not a waste
Fax
Its not a complete waste of money
Well ofc if it was then that would be quite the crimeBut giving tk the people what you can obtain for free is still quite shadyif anybody is intrested in making content then they would know the uselessness of these courseor rather the fact that it is free if u look for it
Charging this little amount is also a problem Think about it like art school just getting a course is not the important part for being a artist In this course its even worse because they teach what is already available
Your comment will be deleted
If you are thinking of doing something great then you must have a taste of everything 
And they are providing their experience in affordable range so its not a waste of money u can try it
 Respectively That is just some wordplay which does make sense If you are thinking of doing something great you must have a taste of everything
I think you guys needs  million plus subs to make these types of course In my opinion its too early to share your experience until you reach to that level
Selling course showing hope is biggest scam just do yourself whatever you want
but we gotta understand the yt algorithms and stuffs too but youre right too
True
Where is project kura
Im out 
abo majja aauna vo 
They fulfill ohr dreams without asking us You both guys are Awesome  Best Collab 
Good luck keep making good videos
If any of you thinks that watching paid course of  how to make youtube video or how to create videos will make you creator you should definitely visit your therapist using that money 

anyone with keen to make videos can make videos and content of all these paid course you will find freely on YouTube


Didnt expect this from The Nepali comment and i never like that indept video storytelling technique
I know right Looking at their overview they are rebranding and reselling surface level knowledge But they know for a fact that nepali bheda i mean people will buy it regardless without even researching because they worship content creators and artists
Agreed

Hi Daju

Really important need part 
As a kid I remember watching this amazing mans interview in Dishanirdesh hosted by the legendary Vijay Kumar As young as I was I remember being completely speechless and awestruck by his incredible journey
He visited  mountain climbers
             
Daju what about passport
Kehi info dinus na
How did he get visa to all those countries
My biggest flex is i have met him in real life
 solace ma lina namaneko  solace ma manyo
How was he allowed to travel without visa or passport  I really wana know
Youtube Ma K Nahune Sathi haru Milera Aghi badau haiii

How did he visit everywhere without any visa
So whats the conclusion bro
Getting goosebumps and feel extravagant motivation
Pushkar Shah the ultimate man who did hardwork and got the goal
Really inspiring story

Hi Daju 
Pin my comment
           
Pushkar Shah of Nepal is the hero of the world by travelling through a bicycle only
Nuwakot KO le help garyo  ma ni nuwakot KO ho
Aba yo channal le ni Aid dinxa bikeko vannuki promote
puskar dai real hero
Great Man 
pushkar sir
Jana sakinxa if aafu ma himmat XA vane maile ni haal Sadhai KO lagi Nepal chodera Aaye Nepal KO halat yesto vaisakiyo ki man xaina Nepal chadna Tara future le badhey banaudo raixa so aarko juni Nepal ma Jeevan na hoss Kasai KO
Internet ko ramro development navako bela ma Mr Puskar shah did travel the world huge respect to him sano ma News ma sunda damnfor real he travelled  Vanera proud lagthyo but these recent time ma I have been seeing him in medias saying country le malai tyo garebapat kei diyena hyan tyanI am so done with him now 
Desh le uslai travel gar vanera khatayeko hainaindividual contribution ko lagi gareko travel bata aile ayera country bata expectation rakhna mildainarefugee haru lai gayera sodhnu how much it means to have a name of your country in your identity Dherai interview herxu sir ko everytime he relates a thing like country le kei diyenaI feels shame
What happened to that Chinese girl
Without passport
Imagine flying in ocean he reached new Zealand with cycle I was like what what the fuk

I am Brom in Dolakha 
Luh kta ho chyang Khana Hina
Puskar Shahs incredible journey has truly been an inspiration showcasing remarkable resilience and determination His adventurous spirit and unwavering resolve despite facing countless challenges make this episode one of the most inspiring yet
mad respect for this guy 
Big salute brother Puskar Saha  Dolakha batai ho ma Pani  tarw jaha  bata bhaye Pani Hami sabai nepali
such a brave guy but i wonder how come he had cross the country without land border and what about visa
Long time back I used to read about his these  adventures in wave magazine

Plz dont put advertisements in middle of the video  I suggest better you put at the end
U should have told abt his after life like how poor he his and how govenrment rejected his trophies to pt in the museum 
I have read his book when i was at grade   and i feel so happy that you guys covered  his journey  thank you so much TNC 
Happy Birthday Sharad
Keep shining and exploring

Puskar Shah Read his book a long time ago and always wondered why he wasnt given more hype and praises 
I recommend his book to everyone Puskar shah  sansar lai sade panch fanko

Now sarad koirala doing like this 
But how  he manage  his expenses  like going to train  visa   other legal permit    how he survived  nowadays  
Such a humble guy I m a cyclist too
His book is more interestingit feels like we are traveling with him Huge respect to the living legend 
I read his book when I was in  class back in  and guess what it was amazing to read every pages of the book  Just worth it 
The every travel description seems like a  presently vlogging scenario
GazZav ko kaam bro
Nice
visa na bhaye cycle ma America ni jana painxa ra
Now we Nepalese know how easy it was to visit Europe for Nepalis in the past
Easy
how did he get the border pass
In that timee border pass is too free for all human
This is what my unemployed friends use to do
lots of love from Phidim panchthar Dai 
 Editor le map finalize garna birse jasto cha
Sansar lai Ek Phanko or Sadhe Paanch have read his book  in my low times it helped me in many ways directly indirectly
Nuwakot ko manxe  Helps Him
hello
Biggest fan from far west side sida Achham Bata 
Reading his book rn He visited  countries according to the book Started with Rs  After returning to Nepal he gave that money back to his mother Truly inspirational 
A quote from the book that I loved  If money was the only thing required to travel billionaires would have travelled to all the countries You need courage more than money
But he visited  countries as mentioned by him
 Sorry I counted only the country mentioned in the book before the stories of each continent He travelled  countries before returning to Nepal Sorry for the confusion
Is reading thebook worth it
 Yes good storytelling There are parts where some people might get offended but its a good book
Has he mentioned about visa in the book  I wana know if he needed visa or not to travel
nssjhdl In some places i think yes but ofcourse you need visa to travel

Make videos on politics in Nepal now politics is improving in nepal in my opinion 
can you elaborate it cause I dont think so
 politics is tight example ilam more independent and less party influenced leaders rising shows politics can turn back in   its my opinion  
Alik sudreko xa tara thorai matra
 ok I respect your opinion
 but lets see when will it happen

I think the course is pack of information on a topic but today you can get anything onli  If you really wanna grow on YouTube I woul like to recommend the best YouTube channels like       And Try To Watch Podcasts of Creators like Mrbeast Ryan TrahanColin And SamirMkbhdThugeshEtc YouTube is a Long Long Long Journey Just Keep Grinding 
Bro started his downfall
Please Mali ne support garnuna
I dont like in depth story
Popularity corrupts
I am too a content creator 
Best Both Creators  
Now here you get unsubscribe 
I wasnt expecting this from you TNC Well about IDS his videos and the things he used to do were biased in themselves so I wasnt really surprised to see him doing this But you TNC Im disappointed

Not hating but get ready for down fall in yt carrer
First revive your channel See the views of this video
lamo mug haru aafno video ma million views kateko chaina vudeo banauna sikaune re I unsubscribed these fools
I think you guys needs  million plus subs to make these types of course In my opinion its too early to share your experience until you reach to that level
Kailash Siwal CEO of Kantipur Media Most Power Full Person of Nepal plz yesko bari ma Video banauna paryo Sir

Editing ko course banauna partyo ksm yeti appreciation pautheu hola brother but yo yt course is not beneficial at all 

Cause k garni k

Yt course le k garni

Baru from scratch to advance level editing like you guys do documentary style editing that could help Neplese audience to learn video editing 

Ani foreign client lai kam garera huntyo ki nepal kai client ko lagi kam garera huntyo they would earn 

Ani baru price halka high gareni kei huntheyna cause 

Video editing rmrri sikyo vaney rmro portfolio banayo vaney client paunu  nai cha

But YouTube is uncertain and many Nepalese people timi haruko video herni doesnt Want to start a channel by themselves 

Cause these all things are saturated but video editing would never get saturated and never will as well 

Dani huntyo video editing sikako vaye time lagayera ra price badhayera

Tara ava easy money fast money ko sochma koilai benefit nahuni course banayera jhyau mattra gardeu ani boycott bhayu dubai jana 

Kei contribution ta huntyo yr video editing ma banaideko vaye ani paisa ni fix autyo with huge appreciation from people 

Aile comment section herda criticism ra hate matra cha 


Ani marketing ma ewta term huncha k Survey vanni ho tyo garincha 

Afno product lai market ma utarna vanda agadi

Timi duita le sodeko vaye huntyo
Video editing or YouTube course vanera ani poll ma vote jesma dherai autyo tesma course banauna partyo

K childish kam gareko hola easy money ko lagi

Unsubscribe gardeko la

Whatever you say is one of the part of the story but I like your content brother others contents are good but the contents you provide are authentic and genuinely relatable with the viewers no comparisons with others
To learn YouTube you can find courses training and videos easily on the platform itself So I dont think you have to buy anything if you truly want to pursue YouTube
Yo indept story wala ta totla set ko xora ho paan thukera bol
The downfall vanere tmi hru ko video auxa aba kei time me 
LOL
Lutna sake lut kanxa 
Kasme kam   million  purayera ta bech course  bibek bindra haru
Yesta course     youtube       
Ignore the positive comments ok tds x tnc
Aba dictatorship ma kaile banauxau video
People in Nepal dont know where to spend money
They will waste k anywhere else than buying courses and attending seminars for their personal growth
Im not claiming that this course is value for money but the point is that why should we criticise them Are they stealing your money Are they selling fake hopes 
They are selling their talent and experience and nothing is wrong with that in my opinion
lol that means 
you shouldve supported Vivek Bindra back in the time of controversy
 Vivek was selling fake hopes but they arent claiming any extra ordinary things
You cant compare  fake MBA titled course with this course
But always its your own perception and I respect that
Becoming a YouTuber You dont need to buy any of course Just ask CHAT GPT I dont think selling a course on how to youtube will be sold  Nepali Comment Rather try to make course on something different like using chat gpt Nothing wrong selling this course but i think this is not a good idea  for first course Should have tried different different concept IN depth story i dont like that guy Videos based on assumptions more than facts
Kamau kamau kta ho comment garne sab kei garna nasakne haru What you think right is actually right Ignore every other thing
Guys yiniharu ko Channel unsubscribe garau sab milera
like indian getting to some faang and selling their dsa courses
You guys forgetting what actually works
Ma hazur sanaga personally contact garera  video YouTube ma Halna chahanxu
For months you guys were my two of my favorite YouTubers from Nepal today you lost it Selling YouTube course Xya
You guys couldve made a collab video about how to be successful on YouTube describing youtubes algorithm and many more tips
There are lots of videos on YouTube which are available for free thatll teach people how to do YouTube YouTubes algorithm is weird and it differs through time
Aile Nepal ma jasto type ko videos Nepali harulai manpardeixa alik samaye ma manparna xodxa Just like how paila paila chalne videos haru aile kunei youtuber harule banayo vane chaldeina Look at daily vlogs ek jamana ma wild chaleko ho aile views consistent xaina Ek jamana ma PUBG gaming wild chaleko ho aile xaina Why Because peoples interest keeps on changing Ani YouTubes algorithm is all about watch time Ani how to get more watch time Audience Retention high hunu paryo tyo retention ma kaam garna gaaro xa Manxe ko interest jamayera rakhna gaaro xa Kunei manxe le sikayera sikne kura haina yo YouTube algorithm vanne kuro YouTube is all about self growth and experiences The more you do the more experience you have the more youll learn the more youll know about YouTube
Esto faltu course and all are just nonsense Free ma paune kura bechirako xan yar Manparena malai chai pitikkei pani
Just go to their site and see tya lekheko titles haru viewers le YouTube ma aayera search garyo vane hajarau video vetinxan testa khalke I will still say YouTube algorithm vanne kura aafule garda gardei aafei sikna sakne kura ho kunei ekkei choti tha vayera blowup hune kura haina It may take time for a few few may get successful within days too

You guys couldve made a video about YouTube and its algorithm selling course wasnt pachauna sakne kura for me
Its similar to Andrew Tate selling Hustlers University courses and I hate that
I aint reading all that
Sab kura youtube ma free ma sikinxa bhanya why we need to buy your course
Simple there is no need to

Oh my god i cannot even imagine
Eagerly waiting 
Looking at all the comments it is quite evident that we Nepali are very quick to negate everything and bad mouth about others
What bad mouth you know and I know this is a pathetic attempt to make money  What do you want to learn anyway They arent even right channel to learn it They barely Cross k subscription even with both combined
sucvï¿½ You are absolutely right
I thought something big Khulasa or huge content when I heard BIG COLLABORATION only to be disappointed by Cash Garb course
Everything is free on YouTube Please Research on YouTube Rather the purchasing Courses 
Please dont buy these coursesNobody till know has became successful after  buying these course
The collaboration we needed
It is business 
Nice Good to know may both has a successful update working together m
Reseach garna tanka dahal bata sikau ho chapri youtubers
lol I dont think its time yet to be teachers guys people will watch you for who you are I feel like this course is BS Dont be diverted
Katro hatar ho paisa kamauna 
I dont think this is a smart move 

Maybe you two might have done collaboration in something else

There exist no goodwill of online course selling

But u proved me wrong today
Umm yll
Same paisa Kamauna lagxan

Jun jogi aaya ni kanai chireko  another paid course GURU
Lutnu ta ho
If you want to become a successful content creator you wouldnt even consider buying this course Even with just a bit of research youll discover that theyre merely selling superficial knowledge coated with their own fame The trend of Selling Dreams as Courses isnt anything new and its expected from these socalled articlereading extremists However they know for a fact that Nepali people will still buy it because they worship content creators
Bro your comment is going to be deleted
 If they have got guts then they will reply to it but you know its a scam if they delete it
True shit man I appreciate that 
Fax
It would have been useless if the cost was very high I dont think it would be waste of money as they are not charging exorbitantly Though caveat to this is price is too low
 yup
They arent charging which might make people broke So its probably not a waste
Fax
Its not a complete waste of money
Well ofc if it was then that would be quite the crimeBut giving tk the people what you can obtain for free is still quite shadyif anybody is intrested in making content then they would know the uselessness of these courseor rather the fact that it is free if u look for it
Charging this little amount is also a problem Think about it like art school just getting a course is not the important part for being a artist In this course its even worse because they teach what is already available
Your comment will be deleted
If you are thinking of doing something great then you must have a taste of everything 
And they are providing their experience in affordable range so its not a waste of money u can try it
 Respectively That is just some wordplay which does make sense If you are thinking of doing something great you must have a taste of everything
I think you guys needs  million plus subs to make these types of course In my opinion its too early to share your experience until you reach to that level
Selling course showing hope is biggest scam just do yourself whatever you want
but we gotta understand the yt algorithms and stuffs too but youre right too
True
Where is project kura
Im out 
abo majja aauna vo 
They fulfill ohr dreams without asking us You both guys are Awesome  Best Collab 
Good luck keep making good videos
If any of you thinks that watching paid course of  how to make youtube video or how to create videos will make you creator you should definitely visit your therapist using that money 

anyone with keen to make videos can make videos and content of all these paid course you will find freely on YouTube


Didnt expect this from The Nepali comment and i never like that indept video storytelling technique
I know right Looking at their overview they are rebranding and reselling surface level knowledge But they know for a fact that nepali bheda i mean people will buy it regardless without even researching because they worship content creators and artists
Agreed
Guys yiniharu ko Channel unsubscribe garau sab milera
