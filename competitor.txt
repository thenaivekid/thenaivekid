You talk so fast I sometimes think Im waching on double speed but Im not
 all you care about is money   youre a terrible interviewer   youre dead inside and it shows
I dont agree saying regularly post Some channels have blown up just upload one or two videos a year 
But amazing videos
I started YT on th April   I have  videos and  subscribes still going on  SOMESH TRAVEL WORLD
The video said the course costs  but the website says 
Taking it serious this time
I just cannot thank you enough  Loved the video will definitely try to implement things mentioned
I have  followers and growing on tiktok How do I transfer them over to YouTube and create a community on here
what editing app do you use
Nice work 
Thumbs up
Indeed a very useful video Ive watched it several times to understand it well and I hope to grow my channel too Currently I only have  subscribers but I wish to have more and youve helped me do that You have a very interesting channel Ive subscribed to you and I hope others will too
Thank you great content but I must say that it is incredibly difficult to create a youtube channel great honour to those who manage this
subscribed to your channel
 you so much 
man i was so scared of starting because of social anxiety now i realise I have nothing to worry about as no one sees them lmao
I appreciate that people that have made it still choose to make videos helping and encouraging others to do the same
your channel will explode you will become millionire 
To the person who is reading this dont give up on your channel Keep going its going to be better
video is over a year old early 
Great
Sungguh sulit mencapai  jam tayang
such a great informative and motivational video Thanks ABDAAL
Is there fulltime Youtube academy  Or is it only partime 
Barakallahfik I like thebway you have demonstrate the topic
Does anyone know a video or creator who talk about doing YouTube on the hobby side while caring about the quality of the content I cant find anyone the videos I find always are on this productive and business side Its quite exhausting
I want to look like you
You just need to dive in
Im trying bro lol Im still at  subscribers its hard bro
Might help to change your name your title And make a nicer profile pic You look nice but its like youre photoshopped in the white empty void
Theres zero way to know what your channel is about by just looking at your profile pic and name
If you didnt say you were trying to get subscribers id assume you were a boring random comment with no content on your channel 
Bet youd immediately see a boost if you only changed how you present your channel on youtube 

Example fro vs Cooking with Fro Adventures with Fro Fro goes to LA

i through now i can easily start one youtube with  and can easily find my niche and learn by  years of exprience one but unfortunately clicked on link and it say to pay  if I started and get paid only that time I can able  purchase
correct im over thinking
I can edit i can make videos  gaming acting ect im just not sure
Just make a video and see if you hate it or if it inspires you to make more  no harm in an attempt
I have a question i live in France could I target uk audience from France
This video has way too much fluff
Love this advice For the longest time Ive contemplated starting a channel but Im over thinking the niche and all those fears and what ifs that comes with the unknown of making your voice public Thanks for the encouragement and tips for getting started
Fun fact Did you know you squeeze the trigger not pull it
Thanks for sharing
rich kid ultra pro max
Stay persistent and never lose heart youll make it through
Thanks for the motivation
Very nice but you speak English fluently and very fast msa
Could you make subtitles please because I like your way to talk
well said very informative
I loved the part of go you want to treat YouTube as a business or a hobby Like in this scale from  to  You are not allowed to pick  That was me fr 
Thank you so much this means a lot and am definitely starting my YouTube journey  May Allah bless you 
Ive really been watching him since he start that is crazy love to see the growth
Help new channel to grow 
Live the dream and go for it i started my YouTube last month im excited about the journey
Thank you so much for sharing all of this information
OMG you nailed this video  You just helped me so much  I took notes 
why this white band down in the video 
Thanks for your clear explanation
My content is about Cambodian lifestyle and street food 
How do you expect anyone to enroll in your course and take you seriously when the actual enroll button is spelled enrol on your website Fix it
would it make sense to start a youtube channel record say a dozen videos prior and dropping them all in the first  weeks or all at once like if its a series
i ask this bc some ppl wait forever or maybe never end up finishing a series and you get sucked into the first  parts but then theres no other videos to watch on their channel so then you go elsewhere and maybe never come back
where is the  course I only see 
Really inspiring content as always Here is to small channels learning and growing
If I would have to start again on YT I just wouldnt waste months to get recognized by couple hundred people When I discovered I could trigger organic growth after getting first few thousand subscribers and views I used a bit of Famester my life and my YouTube journey became a lot easier People are just looking at the numbers when searching for some content If you have low subs no one cares about you even if you have the best content on platform
This is a scam This is a bot
I just started a faceless channel
Ive begun to collect some footage on walking my dog
Bro just change the thumbnail this video was created in 
This guy is a vibe
I ried to purchased but failed due to not knowing coupon code
There was literally a ZERO knowledge transfer here I kept waiting for you to say ANYTHING that wasnt surface level cliche This is the first time I wanted a refund from a free video before
Good lesson 
Hi  The video says  the link says 
Can someone like my comment 
Because Im going to come back in the next days fully monetized 
 Ask me Howfar I have gone
 days woahwell wish you good luck
So good 
Thank you for your  subscribe i hope your family will live forever 
Procrastinated for years and years   Now Im finally learning so much and getting somewhere If I can do it so can you 
Hope to be on your scholarship ali Promise I will be a rewarding alumni happy vlooging 
Always wanted to start a youtube channel your videos are so engaging Im transitioning from my current role into cybersecurity Ive been doing it for about  months so starting to get a fee of what people need to to know to get into the field
Your content is trash All I heard is course cpurse course Scam
Im in a committed relationship with Youtube now lol it used to be casual but im pushing myself now Im so close to k subscribers and its motivating me so much
Working hard is what needed any recommendations about improving Faceless channels

Im extremely curious what kind of human being would dislike this video when the content is so spot on really its perfect So I have a hard time understanding how this video has  dislikes
THANK YOU for getting right to the point Ive watched so many people talk for several minutes before they even get near their point
it was amazing the ninja spam about the book and the other thingsyou a genius Nooice
Nice video
Watching this as I wait for a video to export  I heard you reference Austin Kleon  who I quote in the video Im exporting  I know hes not underground or anything but it was a nice creative coincidence
Very nice 
Im glad came across this video thanks

 Business
Thank you so much inspiring me  I have started this channel  days ago Today I have  Subscribers and  hours views this video gives me much confidence to carry on
Nice video but you talk too fast most of the time
Du you speak that fast or do you speed up the video in editing I like your content but I have to choose a slower speed 
Need to start ASAP can I get a partner
Posting in  Well make it someday Keep pushing and posting guys
Wow Youre the smartest marketing guy Thank you for the video

Thank you for such informative video I just started my vlog youtube channel Posted a few shorts and hope to take it further to more and more helpful contents
Fingers Crossed
Why are you talking so damned fast  Listening to this is like trying to look into the windows of a bullet train while youre running alongside it  Slow down
This video makes me feel motivated
great stuff
Wheres this dollar thing
Its actually 
I visited your website and the part time youtuber academy course showing for 
Total sc um tactics You can learn it all for free on YouTube
May want to have somebody check your landing page for typos
Yeah like the  course that he says is 
it is good
I would LOVE to know what your camera is the quality is amazing please let me know
follow me and i will follow you
Thanks for this video Im just getting started and looking to learn from the pros 
infomercial 
Great content once again
I would break down the just posting a video to smaller hurdles like just downloading some software as these hurdles at the start are the biggest ones youve faced so it seems a lot more possible if theyre broken down
Step  rename all  videos to 
He renamed the video from  to  
Finally got going and even uploaded my videos few days ago To all new youtubers dont gove up we too will achieve our dreams Stay blessed 
Buen da
Tnks for this
I wld work more on my channel 
I hope I get to grow my channel this year 
Leave a comment if you want we grow together 
Hey Ali is the  offer still going
Yes for only 
Just stumbled on your channel and subscribed I hope to learn more
I liked Landons pace but also like Parkers call to action
I m watching this from Pakistan i m also running a challenge keep supporting me
Im embarrassed to admit this but I wanted to start a YouTube channel in  and granted in between here and there there have been some big life obstacles I have getting in the way but I really have no excuse for not doing it especially since I had no life obstacles for the first three or four years after that My biggest hurdle right now as I dont know what my niche would be but maybe after I take your course I can figure that out
Good information 
Glad to know I am on the correct path 
I think I am at the end of  videos stage
I like your contents but Im getting tired trying to chase and understand your words because you talk too fast  But anyway this is impressive and very helpful
My YouTube channel is currently focusing on music themes and this information is truly useful
WoooowI watched this and posted my first youtube vlog today No more procrastination
What if i dont want a profitable channel but just educational videos that help my prospects find good content and then they stick Like I dont need a million followers I need  people to see my video and appreciate its value Thats enough but the question here is how hard is it for me to optimize on SEO if I only have those  views for example
The course is a  not  
The relationship analogy is a killer one As a matter of fact this video was the final point for me to get into a serious relationship with YT As Im about to publish the rd video and move to level  Im trying to follow this roadmap as closely as possible Thank you
Thank you
The best way is to stop consuming and start creating
Thanks to ali abdaal I made my videos and I got around  subscribers in two weeks This is something I shouldve tried before Anyways I wont stop sharing videos in future Im at my th video
perfect 
I recently started my YouTube channel I was really nervous and confused that I should do that or not but yes i did it and i think it was the best decision 
Im starting too
Thank you 
Please guys lets go and up our channel LOVE YOU ALL
Keep trying Keep improving Keep believing Wishing fellow small channels to have an amazing journey in yt 
Its crazy how so many Youtubers have millions of followers but theres not that many ppl in the world  

Right
New here 
Always wanted to be a Gaming Youtuber Never started 
Every  seconds his video changes could that be a stragety
so far I am halfway into your video and I am totally interested in your explanation Thanks a lot
Thank you Ali I want to get started and love your channel  great job on this into and how to get started
Thanks for always sharing knowledge and insights in abundance It is sincerely appreciated
How can I pay the one dollar please cause I need to grow my YouTube please
I know my niche I just need to learn the process and technology I finally got over using my face or voice in videos so Im experimenting with that I was treating my videos like conversations and not thinking about the hook  Im totally new to editing videos and have not found an intuitive software I also think that I need to make better videos instead of many videos Quality over quantity
Theres also a tool launching thats basically an AI scriptwriting helper that trains on existing youtube channels of your choice so you can try out different cadences tones of voice etc Search for Skryptly hope that helps
first  videos released I feel better just for starting
 videos in Thanks
Thank you for this man youre awesome
Do I have to speak as fast as you to have a Youtube channel Serious question
Misleading content due to improper update 
The title says  but this video was posted literally a year ago a whole lot of advicetrends change in a year The link for the program also prompts you  for the program and NOT  as mentioned in the video probably cuz you have since changed the course price Love your videos but your team seems to be slipping a bit and this might probably harm your brand image GL
Interesting information 
My question has been how many shorts do I post vs fulllength videos I dont want to mess with the algorithm so Ive been worried about doing a short and a fulllength video each week What works
You should work on both
I started about  months ago and have been trying to improve something every week Ive been able to go strong with uploading a video each week but Im still struggling to find my audience You have to be committed for sure and I am but I still need help Lol I love it though so thats why Im pushing forward Im not giving up yet
Your facial features are Arab
I thought you were Arab 
I got a lot of takeaways from this but its the first time Ive heard inspirational as value  added to the mix of entertainmenteducation  I was able to get clarity about my niche  I am super stoked about it  thank you
Great tips The struggle to get genuine engagement is real I started focusing on crafting engaging content and bios with famegrowers Its subtle but makes a huge difference in how fans perceive you
Which microphone is good that connect to IPhone
Hi Ali My name is Sechaba and Id like to apply for your scholarship if this offer is still available Im a fitness coach who specialises in Russian kettle bells residing in Johannesburg South Africa I really want to master YouTubing so asking for some help with your course scholarship
The game of youtubeI loved this 
Its a very useful video as a new YouTuber I find this really helpful Thank you so much for sharing your knowledge 

Ali Abdaal makes sitdown videos look so entertaining to watch
I hope my channel grows and anyone whos is upcoming too
Imagine  year down the line this video is helping people like me to start and continue growing on YouTube
I have an Instagram and TikTok account and would love to start YouTube My hesitation was the filming If I film for YouTube it needs to be landscape and the other two platforms are portrait mode  Was the easiest way to make this work without crazy editing
hi
Love this  just starting out  enjoying content creating but its disheartening not having many subscribers will keep trying
Hi i have always had an intense passion for content creation and i started youtube when i was  I learned adobe premier for editing and started editing recording myself and did everything from scratch But then my YouTube account got deleted because i was too young and then i didnt continue again i still love it so much but Im scared that it will be embarrassing and people close to me will start hating me
I have just started my youtube journey Can you guys show some support 
wow
Im rlly demotivated in creating new videos as its quite hard for small extremely small youtubers to start out with high expectations
same here Started my cooking channel since Nov  consistency is the key
I restarted making Indian food videos since Dec  and I agreed with the important pointers that emphasis should be on Just Start  Keep Going
The consistency part is definitely the hardest part after getting past those first few videos and finding a niche 

Genuine Question for all the other small YouTubers how do you rearrange your schedules to edit or videos or do you care more about creating consistent content than focusing on quality
Its the most difficult part for me as well it is not easy at all Sometimes I will stay up all night to edit and publish it Sometimes if I cant finish a good video I will make a different one first with inferior quality So I have more time to finish the good one I am trying to publish  videos every month and so far Ive suceeded  videos this year How about you
I have to squeeze video editing in between a full time job and a side job of building a media company I have to time block my day a lot and on the weekends Im spending a lot more time working than doing fun things at the moment But its okay  
Where do you edit your videos
Great points Thank you
          
      
Do Learn Do
Getting started 
Some days are very slow sometimes i feel a bit down because when i post a video I literally get   subscribers but Im trusting God and my progress

I got my first  subscribers and I cant tell you how great I felt

Great content thanks for the video
As a newbie youtube still struggling to grow i find this video very helpful and i am leaning all this tricks that for putting courage back in me 
lets do this guys
I was born with eyes that dont work like normal For me they involuntarily move left and right rapidly So it looks like I cant focus on something Thats made me quite camera shy and hard to look people in the eye irl

For anyone who sees this could this almost be considered my edge If I turn that camera shy guy into a positive and provide a bit of uniqueness on my potential channel
your cuality audio is soo good
Thanks this helped 
Great content as always 
Some people are so good at this
I just sent it Ive been posting this week and getting over the first hurdle was definitely the hardest but so gratifying
awesome thank you for sharing this advice
SYSTEMS THANK YOU SOO MUCH FOR THIS
 its overthinking
Hello  I need your help with an issue on my channel Despite creating it  months ago I stopped posting for a while Now that Ive resumed Im having trouble reaching my audience with some posts going unnoticed Can you assist me in reviewing the privacy settings or suggest other ways to increase engagement
God I love your voice
Why the video is sped up
People say that money is not the key to happiness but I always figured if you have enough money you can have a key made
The greater the passive income you can build the FREER you will become
Always put your finances in good care to ensure that your income rises Wealthy people achieve there financial goals and acquire riches by seeking help from finance pros but many claim to have achieved success themselves
Thats a just approach Im  but my financial life is a mess Any ideas will go a long way in shaping my life and finances
I operate a wide range of investments and have achieved massive growth in my finances with the help of my financial professional making my financial goal a reality

DONALD NATHAN SCOTT
Making money is action keeping money is behavior and Growing money is knowledge Building wealth involves developing good habits like regularly putting money away in intervals for solid Investments And financialmanagement is a crucial topic that most tend to shy away from and ends up haunting them in the near future
What differentiates the poor from the rich is what both do with the information they get  While the poor doubt almost all the information they find the rich get richer by doing things the poor couldnt do with information they get For financial success and in investing always work with a financial advisor who is ready to help you succeed
Yeah it isnt the key Its just one thing which helps to live
Im from South Korea I started my YouTube channel in  Thanks for the advice
Ive been watching tons of these types of videos the last couple years and this is by far my favorite So clear to the point organized focused I really appreciate the easytofollow outline
I just started my channel wish me good luck
Thank you
I started my YouTube channel by just posting shorts and its been an interesting journey I post everyday
I did the same but still no progress
To the person who is reading this dont give up your channel Keep going its going to get better
Thank you

A year old video about 
Thanks DAli
This is valuable  Im on that way now
Hi  thanks for the video

I did my first  videos and they got really low retention 
I want to try to fix it but should I bother trying with the same channel Is YouTube not going to push my videos now at all now

I put out my th and its gotten  views 

Do I have a chance to fix  my retention  with the same channel
Or should I just start again
Hey with youtube new policy of getting k subscribers in  months and  watch time i had to create a new channel too

I started last week And this time I personally messaged my friends and families letting them know I started a YouTube channel

So that way I got subscribers from close friends and now my subscribers are slowly increasing 

You can do that too 
 please do you mean if you get a thousand subscribers even after months it wont be considered being eligible to be in partnership with YouTube
 hi you Google Youtube monetization policy 
When you think about people like Ali iJustine MKBHD Arun Jimmy and all these people  the common thread is that its impossible to dislike these people I think thats a major contributing factor to the success of these YouTube channels
I started and my goal is to get the k  cant wait 
Wow
 The forgiver of all wrongs around  years ago was Jesus the son of God God is the creator of everything To life Breathe air
Amazing video
Thank you
Uploaded a short yesterday Ill be back when i become successful with my channel 
Great social is better
Get going And make small improvements along the way
When just starting a YouTube channel if you plan on sharing different categories of information would you create  different YouTube channels Or just one channel and put everything under the same channel Example Homeschooling Videos Electronic Tech Support computers cell phones and craft videos like Cricut tutorials and craft making Thank you so much for all this wonderful information
bla bla bla thanks for telling me basic shit  minsguess it works for most wannabes watching this
Finally started my channel and posted my first video today 
AceBachelorCool knows whats up
Level   videos dont care about niches and after made  videos do you want to commit at least make one video per week
Level   videos get better at making good videos dont care about niches still
Your editor needs to let you breathe
Great Idea Thank you
Just made the jump recorded and posted yesterday my first video It was nerve wrecking and really proud of you Esther
what is your setup man camera light etc 
me picks 
Ali next second youre not allowed to pick 
I learn a lot
Does anybody know which editting Programs were used for this good quality video
Love this video thank you for it Would you start out by putting your name only or a name or name it not related to your first and last name if you know what I mean
Do you think its ok even if I have school
Step  Start   Step  Get gud   Step  clickbait people
you are way to expensive  you are crazy
Actually decided to start my Youtube channel about a month ago Its a big learning curve but also lots of fun Each subscriber I get makes me so fricken happy and hypes me up to a insane level
When I started I didnt know what type of videos would work I know Ill get the subscribers now the watch time will be the focus Thank you for this advice 
You talk alot nonsense at first and discouraging
These tips are so easy and accessible Ive been wanting to make videos for ageeeessss but step  and overthinking holds me back Well not anymore  Im gonna go for it this year starting somewhere in spring once Im done with my master thesis so I dont procrastinate on graduating
Hi Where is the  course I cant find it
Do you have the systems course as a recorded offering Im seeing this in  so its too late for me 
Should i creat a new yt channel or post on this existing account Ive used for years to just watch stuff
To the person reading this dont give up keep uploading we got this 
These videos keeps me going One day I will look back and thank for the time I didnt gave up
To all those fellows sailing along very best of luck
Love you videos I just started a channel  videos in  views crickets but I learnt that I enjoyed making the videos and songs So I am gonna keep at it Even if nobody ever looks at them 

Truly brilliant video  lots packed in 
Got my first thousand subs in  and the only way is up I hope

I am back here one year later watching this video and have committed to a video a week See you in  
Im starting from scratch I have  experience on this but what I do have passion for  is gaming and Im just getting held back due to self doubting  I just feel like itll be impossible to get a community going  But I want a community I could actually get to know and let people get to know me as a person its always been a dream to talk to viewers interact and show off my unique personality
I procrastinated for so many years to get this started and the journey has finally begun
So youre the famous Ali Abdaal I heard your talk in the MFM podcast and was impressed to learn you were a doctor before becoming a creator 
This is really an informative video
bro i did make  videos in one week and i have already more than  subscribers
Starting a youtube channel is hard and takes time but if youre passionate about what you do then its definitely worth documenting your journey

You said your course cost  dollars I enter the link in the description and see  dollars thats quite the difference
Lets assume you are trying to sell it to amateurs who wants to start and make an additional income why so expensive
I like your videos but I just wanted to point that your course is not affordable for everyone kind of a bummer
I appreciate your kindness to accommodate to those who can not afford your live coaching thank you for making an example of being a New Earth Leader I also loved the main content and how you shared it
What the video says is different from what the title says and this is basically a academy promotion video Disappointed
The secrets color matching the iPhone case to the video background
Great content Im a newbie with  subscribers and I found this very helpful Thanks
Im mom full time I have  years toddler and  month baby absolutely i have no time even to sleep at night  very hard live alone no camera no laptop but I always I want to star youtub channel listening to u give me hope thank u for give me hope and show me the way
Why is it that most YouTubers pedal their own crap all the time
I hope i can be a youtuber like you one fine day
  
  
Imagine all these viewers  Million people wanted to make YouTube channel YouTube viewers  YouTube Coding Channel Creator 
Im finding it hard hopefully i work this out this video is good
This was super helpful for someone starting out  I believe story telling is whats get people watching all the way through Can you please make a video about that
You are talking really fast I checked the play speed  or  times to make sure that is normal 
Nice 
This is the best value video for beginners on YouTube The  video framework is amazing You just need to start The hardest part And then be consistent Another hardest part 
Just for some clarification for the first  videos that we are doin are we making them public or are just doing them so we can get used to the process
FYI you forgot to add your end screen At the end youre not pointing at any videos at the time of writing this comment
just started my channel and got over k views on one of my video and i am happy with it Of course i need to improve my skills in all aspects of youtube
Greatest takeaway is to setup a system I have everything I need professional audio and video equipment software studio etc Time allocation is my biggest hurdle Working a regular  plus producing a weekly podcast I have a lot going on Thanks for sharing this
Clickbait
Thank you

The course is   why you say  
nice I just started my channel recently thanks
One of the challenges many new channels face is the feeling of discouragement when they spend  days creating a video only to upload it and receive just a few views and a few subs Despite this its important to remember that success in the YouTube journey takes time and persistence Embrace the learning process stay committed and know that every view is a step forward on your path to success Youve just begun this exciting YouTube journey and with dedication your efforts will undoubtedly yield positive results Keep creating and stay motivated
thanks for your encouragement Also I have a YouTube channel its not easy

Sharing golden nuggets
Thanks bro
your good man
Sir i need money help Please can you help me
i am thinking of making contents and fr i legit do not know what type of niche i want to pick but i have a rough idea it is mostly just editing that is going to be hard i think and me not stuttering without a script or just using a script and to make it entertaining or detailed summarised so people feel like they are learning something
keep it up my man catch you on IG Daniel and I just had dinner he said we should connect 
Youve helped me start taking my channel a whopping  subscribers now more serious since a week and I intend to make this work Thanks for sharing your wisdom experience and joy
Amazing video thank you for the motivation I just started my YouTube journey  days ago I have to practice more to get more confident speaking to the camera
I recently started filming and posting more videos to my page  my channel gained  subs in x weeks Super happy and continuing to hustle and work towards what I want slow  steady wins the race
I started a furnituremaking channel  years ago I only made  videos and then quit because my wife and I had a baby and obviously that was more important I recently checked the channel only to find I had k views on one video k and k views on the other Might not seem like much to some people but I really wanna start back up
I try it 
Your tutorials are good and theyve helped me alot Sometimes its just inspiration to keep going I have a youtube channel for  year now I started with such enthusiasm and got discouraged life got in the way and I lost my focus Restarted recently and my channel is still not getting the growth that I would want to see 
Is this your voice
Wow i love your content this would really help me
You just explained all my emotions over the last year Where have you been all my life lol
Assalomy alaykum
How do I find editors for a good price Not cheap but also Ive heard of  an hourI work for a guy theres a tool truck tools insurance plus skilled men to work He charges  an hour  for a computer with almost no real overhead seems crazy expensive
Helpful 
I just put up my first video and this is just what I needed Cheers
Great Advice to someone like me who just started and uploaded his first video I have my niche and i know my way but i think one of the big goals is to not look at numbers that much the first  months and just get your routine done
Thanks for your content
I just started a YouTube channel and this is great Thanks so much
I just signed up for the course and the very first  videos put everything into such perspective Ali has a magnificent way of explaining and relating information to make it understandable and actionable

Thank you

I have been working  one one video for one week now  this thing takes a lot of time i am on leave now i dont how i am going to do it if i am back to work
Good channel amazing videos bro
The most important thing is to persevere and not lose the fun What also helps is to watch old videos of yourself then you can see your own development in the video filming and editing etc and you can see how much you have actually achieved That motivates you to keep going 
Wow youre good  Really business savy got me hooked for those first  minutes ONLY to realize this is just a big publicity scam for self promotion going for the  million dollar bracket 
Wahhh this is perfect I startet my channel today and Im really committed to taking this seriously So this is very valuable thanks for sharing
I start a YouTube channel and it works thank you 
So bored of every other video being sold a way to make money
Where is the link for apply to scolarship 
Where is the  course I can only find one for 
YouTube asks for a govt ID My concern is one cannot be anonymous and your ID can be used to dox you Is there no way to start a channel anonymously
Your voice is peace 
DAMN Ok 
Im too shy to put myself on camera
Please
Im trying to make a YouTube channel
As a new creator I find this very informative and useful thanks man
Wow m when i dont even get anything why am i invisible 
My thing is I dont believe in the ideas for a channel i  come up with Ive studied UFOs for  years and I know a lot about them but my understanding based on all knowledge base is not the narrative So I could fake the funk or tell it as I understand it But if I do theres only a certain amount of videos it would encompass I could do it in one I might do one where I stay with the developments Because this subject is likely to be more of a focal point in the world moving forward unfortunately Very unfortunately On a side note please do not be deceived by what the establishment offers and especially the fantastical performances the ETs will do and most notably the world teacher that could maybe possibly introduced by them you know theoretically Thats another thing If I lay it down even illustrating the myriad of evidence and various pieces of the puzzle one would still be for all purposes bat chit crazy Its part of the deal Ok UFOs aside how does one begin to believe in their channel ideas You know you cannot really successfully do something unless you believe in it And that includes a YouTube channel I need to probably brainstorm within myself and find a topic that has the potential to yield many videos and one that would be interesting one  that is current and abundant No matter if there are countless channels on this subject Because with YouTube it is an abundance mindset not a scarcity mindset If you have a good content and you obey the algorithm rules your channel will be propelled to all the recommendations
Should i restart a new youtube channel 
Hey would you say its worth paying for a editig program when starting or not if so what do you use plz

You are real life teacher bro Thanks for your help
I just started this month and Ive already learnt SO MUCH about YouTube
 for me its mostly computer knowledge and building up and making stuff to be able to make content lol
You are very motivating 
how the hell did he glow up that like button of youtube 
 Love From India 
Fear judgement and overthinking are also the same things that stop writers from finishing their book Creating public content is hard I reckon I am an  on your scale
Ive be starting my YouTube channel starting  and I need all the help I can get Thank You 
GOOD
Shorts helped me get monetized in  months It drove eyeballs Ive cut back and am paying for it 
Trying to start my Channel soon good luck to everyone else 
Have you changed the title from  to  
Yes
Yes
Why not 
 yes he did so
It is a technic

The video being a year old is a bit of a giveaway 
Everyone does that because the I formula is the same despite the year lol Work smarter not harder 
I have anxiety You speak too fast
So good so useful so obvious and so hard to actually do The hardest part for me is to commit to a youtube life
Whats your camera and lighting setup look like
Im so glad I found your content You are truly inspirational personable Thank you
I created a channel two years ago but still struggling to get subscribers and viewers
I have been in since Nov    when I posted my first videos Yes only a bit over a month ago I am posting  videos per week my nicheeasy is my business Real Estate is what I do so content is easy The user is defined and the content is always real estate making it fun and different I am building character I am a oneman team at the moment But I have very unfair advantages the content is somewhat evergreen i am getting better editing i am not quitting a job to submerge on youtube i am just submerging into youtube because of my business Does it make any sense the best moment for me was when I realized that I was wrong My thinking before was for the real estate videos that my sellers would not pay for all this work so if I dont sell the propertyuhmI lose all that work Not anymore When i realized after talking to some people and diving into it that youtube will payme for my content i just took the dive No equipment Just my cell and that is it  JUST DO IT you dont have to wear their running shoes
I loved the lecture I came here because I want to create content on YouTube I want to treat it as a business and be fully committed
Hi there Can you please let me know which microphone you used in the video
Do not do it people Unless your timing in life is already treating you well you have a great job all your bills are paid and trouble just seems to mostly leave you alone You have kk to spend on software lighting cameras and so on and so forth Furthermore you will not make anything or have any sense of real success The only time a person makes it on YouTube with zero dollars is if the universe smiles its timing upon you Otherwise you will fail You will spend thousands and thousands of hours learning all the free software You will spend thousands and thousands of hours watching How I made a billion dollars in  or  days  years later as your channel or channels all have oh we will say top  subs and maybe  views You will think to yourself WTF I did everything all the rich influencers told me to do I tried every niche in existence in those  years yet here I am  years later with  subs and  views Thats the actual truth about becoming a successful YouTuber Your odds are almost zero to make this work You sound a bit angry there history dude Yes yes I do I am one of those universe timing hates me with a damn passion I am  now and have tried almost everything every YouTuber says will get you to this many subs et cetera  years thousands and thousands of hours educating myself on software I otherwise would never have bothered to learn thumb nails that probably still look like crap at best average videos I think they are great shortish history videos straight to the point and educational Apparently only about  others have agreed with me in the past  years I see other history channels with s and s of thousands of views The difference was that they had money but they did not make those videos with completely free software About  days ago I just started some shorts on YouTube and TikTok Just like almost every YouTuber has a video about HOW YOU SHOULD DO IT I am thus far not impressed They say I made  in a month with posting faceless shorts blah blah blah or I got  subs in  days with this new blah blah blah It is all bullshit What they did was make a new channel tell their existing base about it or just grab pictures of income from the internet and thats how they got all the subscribers and got monetized So as I said eight days into the latest bullshit YouTubers are saying it is not looking good I have  days left and we will see I predict that everything I have done and will continue to do over those  days will end in complete failure with zero return Timing is all about whether the universe likes you The universe really hates most people which is why everyone is not well off only the chosen few One last thought You might be saying History dude you should make a video about this Yea no No one wants to hear about how the universe is against them and the odds of them getting this to work are about the same as winning the lottery You are saying right now damn you sound like youre feeling sorry for yourself bitching and whining poor me I am a failure Yes I am  years old partially disabled and able to only make between  and  per month working any kind of job I have two ways left to try and leave somethinganythingfor my two girls and my nine grandchildren Those ways are winning the lottery Hahahahahahahahaha or something along the lines of YouTube or TikTok I will be dead in  or  years I am quickly running out of time BTW You cannot even pay rent anywhere in the US for  a month let alone buy food maybe some electricity or some clothes that are not covered in paint Sigh anyway thats my view on becoming well anything but for this purpose a successful YouTuber in any sense of the word I If youre watching any of the influences I truly hope you make it Having the capacity to take care of yourself and your family is a wonderful thing for some
Thanks for the tips I just started posted my first video The editing takes long but there is satisfaction once Im done and I like it I have long ways to go on improving my skill but this is a start I am just happy for now that I am able to share my experience with others 
I will just start with Level  now
I am curious why you speak so fast trying to explain about what topic you have in this video Are you in a hurry I really dont understand what you are saying because its like you are rapping When a teacher teach students they speak slowly to make it easier to understand I want to learn from you but i keep on pausing the video just to understand
You can slow the video down in the settings I hope this helps
Hello from Hanoi Vietnam Thank you so much for your video

Your videos about starting a youtube channel have been so valuable to me This information helped me get started they key is starting and doing more than we think
So good
Finally someone in the UK who is teaching YouTube Well done Ive subscribed 
im starting my chanel a year ago im thinkin so hard at editing my video meanwhile I dont have any editing skill I ended up not uploading any

and then I saw lein xceeds chanel and knowing that his oldest video is literaly just gameplay no face no voice no editing just pure gameplay

and then im starting to think why im not just upload whatever it is

in just a week I got  views
and  Subscribers D
Inspiring I love you
You really deserve a thumbs you I just saw your video for the first time and it lifted my spirits and now it is the time of starting from Level  Thank you 
yeah yeah stfu youtube is luck
No such thing as luck
 yeah there is
 prove it
 no need to some ppl upload mediocre videos and they blow up with no reason at all some do really good content and no one watches it you cant study the algorithm its just luck
The WHY is most important Id say Form  structure  content Seriousness or casualness has really nothing to do with quality per se I already know what my WHY is In the phase I am in life I want to make videos for myself first and foremost I dont care for clicks or growth I want to get ideas and experiences out of my head into a format that is more accessible than writing and where I may find it easily again And I want some of my RL friends to find them as well Anybody else finding them and liking them is at this stage a bonus So regardless of all tips on How To YouTube finding ones own WHY seems to be pivotal Simon Sinek has a lot to say about ones Why
yea i just started when u said  videos thats exactly what i started with lol
Your class is  but you said here that it is  Huh
I just started my channel with st real usefull informationWish me luck

Q
Overthinking is a pitfall for me

Commenting here to manifest my growth here on YouTube   Cozynini Nov 
Gr
Am watching this video because i want my channel to grow upto millions  Thank you for this video  I hope I get here someday

Good advice If you build it they will come but the hardest part is getting started with a worthwhile development that you would want to commit yourself to even when theres no interested audience for your channel yet but yourself steps    Im still learning the craft of making videos roaming somewhere between steps  and  but theres nothing more thrilling and motivating than a subscribed audience thats eagerly awaiting my next video installment and watching them pounce on it when Ive uploaded it I can fairly say that in  Ive been working for a full year on my channel have  published videos  subscribers and  hours of watch time as of this moment and Im only  of the way through the planned video developments What I have noticed is that YouTube loves to promote a brand new video that I get a lot of new visitors on the first day but only for that first day A weekly video upload more or less is best for coaxing new subscribers if youre using YouTube alone to promote your channel
Such a long comment wow 

Forget it is not the content is not the Algorythm and is not merit YoutubeTikTok and others just HandPick who shows and who doesnt any other idea is a PURE ILLUSION pure illusion FORGET IT I KNOW IT 
Wow The course is no longer at

Thank you for the update 
Great thank you
Hey Ali I just wanted to drop a comment to let you know how much your video impacted me After watching it I felt a surge of motivation and took the leap to start my own YouTube channel While Im still navigating the challenges and learning the ropes I genuinely enjoy the process Your insights and inspiration have been invaluable to me Thank you so much for sharing your wisdom and lighting the way for aspiring creators like myself Keep up the amazing work 
Well its quite the spectacle isnt it YouTube the hardworking video platform that takes your cat videos and dance tutorials and manages to squeeze every last penny out of them like theyre running a lemonade stand at a desert mirage

Theyre like that one friend who borrows your stuff makes a fortune off it and then asks for more money while pretending to work tirelessly Hey you Yeah you watching that guitar tutorial Weve got bills to pay too Those Ferraris dont fuel themselves

But lets be real here YouTubes idea of hard work involves hosting other peoples content raking in the ad revenue and then making you endure endless mindnumbing ads while youre just trying to learn how to play Wonderwall on that guitar Its a bit like paying a toll every time you want to cross the bridge to creativity But hey at least theyre keeping the meme economy afloat right
My Second Video just posted So far Im following along with your guide This really gave me a chance to take a breather I love making videos and that is what Im trying to focus on Ive already seen an improvement from the first video I made Video  is scheduled for this Saturday 

Today Im making that ultimate choice Im going in two feet Wish me luck folks Here we go 
Thanks mate
Very nice video
Great tips 
I love this but is a laptop a necessity for editing the videos
Your English is fluent but I can understand every single word youve said
Very helpful content Ive been in YouTube for a while and overthinking is always stopping me Will try these out
Thank you so much for always being so generous with your knowledge Ive learned so much from you over the years and through different life stages too It seems like whatever Ive got on my mind youve got a video on how to do it smarter Keep at it Ali and team
Thanks
Hi I make travel guides
Yes m also making video since  year and i know one day i will be successful
Nice

This is one of the channels that gave me the courage to start my YouTube channel  months ago about self development Now I have  subs and   hours of watch time I know its not comparable with others but Im still proud I started because Ive been learning so many lessons that I could havent learned without getting started in the st place
Best of luck for your future bro 
Well done 
 Whoever you are I dont know you personally but I can say that youre one of the nonjudgmental and openminded people who is not fixated on tangible or external factors in order to learn from someone like me Just because someone doesnt have a piece of paper as a credential doesnt mean that person is not entitled to share personal experiences with the hope  intention to inspire others Keep up with whatever it is that youre doing to improve mankind or improving your life even to a slight degree each day This is just one part of a bigger puzzle for creating my YouTube channel about holistic health I literally could have died back when I was  years old due to major depression but here I am right now replying to you a YouTuber whos full of fulfillment and dedication to help others to be a better version of themselves I aint better than anyone else but my old self Thats all that really makes this YouTube thing more meaningful and enjoyable Thanks so much for your support I am hoping that you can join me with this endless personal development journey 
 Thank you I think what makes me strong is forcing myself to make tons of mistakes learning from them and strategizing how I will approach similar situations in the future so I dont make the same mistakes again Knowing that making mistakes is just part of life gives me the courage to get out of my comfort zone many times because I will never learn something new if Im so afraid of fucking up In fact I recently joined a toastmaster club This weekend Ill be in front of a small group of people to give my st speech on stage which scares the hell out of me but thats ok I know that fear is part of life but its all about having the courage to overcome fears
 Im learning slowlycould be an age thinglolI have  videos and  wonderful subswhy a journey it is just being me God bless from beautiful Ballarat 
I have  subscribers now im happy though I believe the future is bright

good job mate
VoiceStudio Thank you Consistency is also really important for any growth In fact my bags were stolen not too long ago and Im basically back to zero This is just another challenge that I have to overcome Setbacks are just part of life and so learning and growth This is what my channel is all about About being strong whatever life throws at me although its not always easy to stay strong especially during storms but at least try to take even little steps even when it gets tougher Keeping in mind Im not immune to challenges in life like everybody makes me focus on solutions It sucks and I was feeling down for a few days after it happened but I chose to bounce back and start all over again after losing months worth of work as my hard drives were in my stolen bags  of my camera gears are gone but I recently bought new ones to keep going Obviously it will slow down the completion of my next video but as long as I am moving forward thats all that really counts
 Never stop Never Surrender NEVER GIVE UP If life puts stones on your path you throw them back
Well done Inspired by your journey 
Over K
 yes  is another roller coaster ride as I started to shake things up more to pursue personal development and less time editing but that doesnt mean that Im giving up on making content This year I wanna focus on having a property to generate some passive income Taking some freelance gigs is a lot more enjoyable than a typical  job at least in my case Going to the gym getting enough sleep cooking healthy foods at home also take most of my time I know that Im worse than a snail when it comes to content creation but the speed doesnt really matter to me as long as I know that Im enjoying the process of creating content while sharing this knowledge and experience with others with the hope that it could make a positive change on their lives as well 


Have an awesome 
 Hello are you a youtuber
 Hey buddy I also make same content  ie we have same niche sowanna collab

Congrats on getting started Thats great progress 
 Thank you
Implementing the lessons I learned throughout the years of lots of trials and errors changed my life trajectory and learning that theres a yin and yang in everything I wouldnt have appreciated the power of kindness if someone was not cruel to me I wouldnt have realized the importance of growth if I didnt see myself stagnating I wouldnt have appreciated the importance of health if I didnt get sick I wouldnt have realized the importance of real love if I havent witnessed my parents relationship slowly fall apart I wouldnt have appreciated the importance of mindful money consumption if I wasnt broke I wouldnt have appreciated the growth of my YouTube channel if I didnt start at 
Can you assist me in starting mine
Great job

Hello everyone Im not very good at English but recently Ive started my own YouTube channel where I talk about myself My goal is to become a vlogger and Ive also quit my job
bro i learned nothing from this all i learned is this is a yap session
Ive got something that I might need help with I do a lot of work and dont want to leave my job since I live it so much and it is well paying However I also would love to start youtube since it is something that I want to do Is there a possibility of me balancing the  or do I have to commit to one or the other
  The video outlines a threepart framework for starting a successful YouTube channel Get Going Get Good and Get Smart
  Level one Get Going is about making the first three videos to overcome initial hesitation and learn the basics of creating content
  Level two Get Good involves making the next seven videos to improve videomaking skills focusing on craft rather than niche
  Decide whether you want to treat YouTube as a hobby or a business then proceed to level three if you choose the business approach
  Level three Get Smart emphasizes understanding YouTubes game focusing on three key factors click watch time and satisfaction
  Define your niche as a combination of target and value proposition emphasizing personal interests strengths and the people you can serve
  To manage a YouTube channel while having a fulltime job you must build systems and processes to optimize your content creation and save time
I just started few weeks ago I think doing is all it takes the rest takes care of itself

We on our way 

Hello how are you doing 
Just uploaded my first  videos as a series and was wondering if anyone had free time to give feedback on them Im also looking into including shorts into my strategy as well I definitely appreciate these tips 
You talk so fast and there is never any space between I cant listen to it Why are so many YouTubers doing this They even edit their videos to cut out the space between sentences I cant stand to even listen to is I must be in the minority though or else you would not do that
Is wondershare filmora good for editing
do you want to take it seriously or not 
Do you want to make it a business or not get over yourself you fluffer
Terimakasih tutorial bermanfaat
My videos take months to make 
Great stuff  I paused the video to like sub comment and BOOKMARK  Now on with the video
Hello how are you doing 
Right now Im trying to learn editing and make videos and it has been a STRUGGLE But the bright side as I go I learn a lot more I use davinci resolve and it was the most intimidating thing Ive seen in a while Although its been getting slightly easier gaining the content is the hard part for me but editing is much simpler Thank you for the advice bro
Hahha your SEO score only   
Hello how are you doing 
Hlo
Your contents are good but you speak too fast
Thank you for sharing information that is really useful to me  Give me a lot of support on how to make YouTube

Before making a new video i start with a list of ideas That way i can do back to back videos which connect to each other for a nice flow Then i look at a series of other videos on the same or similar thing I make not of what they did well and what they could have done better and i use that to improve and stand out Lastly because i am primarily posting food videos i have a mini photoshoot with my food and kitchen so that my thumbnail is melt in your mouth beautiful while also standing out from the other videos And because i have mini series on my channel i link my videos together with a consistent atmosphere
I am genuine to myself about how i present and speak because i am crafting not just posting
Thanks I needed to hear this
Very good content 
Nice
Its really creepy how you listed off my three main concerns in the matter of seconds
Enjoyed your video 
just bla bla bla for selling the course hes saying general things that all know
Why do u think he has    subs and you have 
Thank you  nice explanations  

Ali your videos are down to the point and helpful Thank you for what you do this is incredibly inspiring
Hi
My dark channel is about my city what bad things in my opinion the people who govern my city have done and are doing to my city and it is also a channel where I post videos of my travels mainly around the United Kingdom
I usually use it in videos about my city memes Using memes can my channel not be monetized
If my channel were yours what would I change What do you think Im still doing wrong
Thanks

If I would to start again on YT  I just wouldnt waste months to get recognized by couple hundred people When I discovered I could trigger organic growth after getting first k subs using Famester my life just got easier and my main channel exploded People are just looking at the numbers when searching for some content If you have low subs no one cares abot you even if you have best content on platform

Informative video Thanks a bunch

I have ADHD I watched until  and had stopped watching for now I will come back after Ive created three videos Next I am going to start learning how to make good videos with iphone
Wish me luck who knows this could be the beginning of it all 
does your courses include the video editing you did in thus video Would love to learn Also dont give up everyone
I appreciate your elocution speed Its quick to the point and no pointless intros Thats a good video right off the bat Usually I always skip intros and put x speed
Your idea for scholarships for your academy is both fantastic from a user point of view and also an extremely good business tactic too Fantastic whoever came up with that idea needs a raise 
I just got started and it is very scary in the beginning Especially talking to what feels like an empty room I decided to go with indie games Hopefully one day I can make people happy and support other channels as well Thank you for this video
They should have taught this in high school as they saw the new thing coming up 

But noooooo
Lets play volleyball an join the broke set up system

This was good advice 
Whats the average watch time you got for this video
The talking and doing the video itself is effortless for me i just dont know how to edit or make thumbnails or anything of that nature
Thanks for the video
I will start my channel in 
Brother you are talking too fast
tysm
Great video Ali great value
This is super helpful  Started my YouTube channel this year  
This video inspired me to get started again thanks for putting out meaningful content consistently
thank you for the advice i appreciate it

Nice brother
I am happy to share that Ive started it  
Hi Brother this is Dharani Iam an acrylic artist and college studentA few months back I wanted to start an art channel but wasnt sure if it will workyou were truly an inspiration for me to start my channelI do my channel works after my college hoursthanks for inspiringkeep inspiring so many peopleGood day
Your moon painting is awesome 
To the person who is reading this dont give up on your channel Keep going Its going to be better 
Im just getting started and Im realizing how much improvement I make just by putting time and living it
What camera do you use
Please consider not waving your hands in your viewers faces I am very interested in your content and expertise But the hand gestures make your channel unwatchable for me
Inspirational  Eventually will work on it 
Great video Working on building my channel as well 
you have to do something very very unique or else nothing will blow you up The average youtube channel takes  videos and around  years to just get k subscibers if you want to do youtube start off doing it for enjoyment and see where it takes you Trust me quality and quantity doesnt matter on youtube until you start posting crazy amounts For example ive made  videos and only have  subscribers and each of these videos take  hours to make
Where could I find your course
Very good informative video
NICE
This is serious for me please
How do I fix these problems 
Already made  videos what is wrong with my method
Hello maam
Hope you are well Are you there
Maam Your channel and videos have some problems Fixing your channel and videos problems will grow your channel very quickly and your views subscribers will increase day by day
Thanks

Ive always spent my time overthinking about being perfect at what i am making and that really drained all my energy to even get started Recently I stopped doing it and finally i have  posted videos on this channel that i think i could have never posted if i kept thinking how i sound and if editing is good enough Overthinking is real deal when it comes to content creation I can say for sure
Hello I am currently having problems with my YouTube account The videos and content in my account is not refreshing and all watch history is outdated How do i get latest trending videos on YouTube such as technology entertainment fashion gaming business etc Can you confirm if my account has been hacked or if my codes have been swaped

you sound and look like MrWhoseBoss Arun Rupesh Maini
Hi from Malaysia 
Growing with your video

Start by seeing your time mx as medical student bcoz DRdadada


Now
Im going to bussiness
And seeing you doing the same thing
Thanks  I started my Youtube channel three months ago this video is really helpful for me
Taking down notes thank you for the important information in this video 
Is anyone trying YouTube shorts I find it hard to show my face
super helpful thank you
I want to highlight that first lesson JUST START So often we feel like we need to know exactly what were doing to start something Where in reality once weve actually made the first step motivation comes much easier
You still need to know what you want to upload
Why my shorts not getting views Please tell
The first step get used to using your camera lighting and sound Sometimes the sound just does not come right get a good film editor software and learn how to use it After a few months you will look back on your first video and realize how bad the filming is
hey which software would you recommend please
PLEASE GIVE YOUR POINTS IN THE DESCRIPTION BOX SERIALLY OK FINE THANKS SAMPATHUN
Do you speak this fast or speed up your videos
Thank you for your update keep up your good work
first thing you need is an Editor and then primary content which is your main thing

Hey Ali Whats your opinion on having  niches on  YouTube channel  Thats what Im transitioning into  Do you think the algorithm will pick this up  Thanks for your time 
I think that I am late to your comment but I can tell you an advise from a guy that has another Youtube channel in Spanish

He said that he attempted to do it and it didnt work because the subscriptors get crazy when they get notifications for a content that is not supposed to be for them
very informatic video keep up the good work
Bro i have uploaded over  videos in one year but there is no break through there for me any advise
I cant find my Niche becasue Im interested in way too many things Like ok I mostly make videos about Ancient Egyptian culture but i ALSO wanna talk about social issues and conspiracy theories and mental health  xD Is it bad to have some videos that are not related to your initial niche
 with MRH
great advice thank you

My goal is to get monetized and be able to pay my bills on youtube so i can focus on building more value into each video or service i provide

The only channel that I never need to increase the Playback Speed for
Maybe youre the only person of color in this niche and so you speak to other people of color just like you Can we ever get past that mindset The mindset that you can only listen to or benefit from words spoken by someone with the same skin color as you How shallow If I had that mindset I wouldve never watched this video
Thanks for this Sir Very insightful
it works for me thank you
Thank you Ali
I created my YouTube channel  but I just decided to try my luck for my account to be monetized September  Honestly Im loosing hope that my account will be monetized 
Consistency is the key  
But Im so lazy to keep posting consistently on YouTube 
I see many fresh new good videos who have only  views others have  viewswhats the reason behind this
Build youtube channel with your own videos or faceless to make good money with it as affiliate marketer daily the question is
How many videos are needed  traffic to make money daily as affiliate marketer on youtube

Happy sunday

Ali no one ever in this world can answer this you are the smartest of all Please tell me is there any possibilities people outside first wolrd country making youtube video using english and people still get promoted to the outside of his country


because somehow I feel youtube plays the algoritm regionally
 thats where I am
U r so awesome
I like the idea of your  first videos to get better and used to it Its a much more feasible goal And will help me to learn to cut and edit quicker
I MUST START USING THIS TACTICS IMMEDIATELY

Crap I wish I can talk at this speed with no single  umm and not losing the point of my talk 
this is so discouraging 
 what in the world is going on When was the last time you or anyone talked so fast I know you dont care about thisbut what is going on
Watching this with only  subscribers for my YouTube biking content 
I will apply this for six months and see how it goes

Thank you for your videos they are so helpful to small creators 
Thanks

thank you Ali
The fact Ive NEVER heard of you but you have mil subscribers is inspiring It lets me know that theres so many people in the world and you have to practice consistency planning and mindfulness
he just bought subs  noway he can earn at least m
 Nope I watched his YT channel like  years ago and at that time he was sky rocketing their videos were gold I would say that his content was not in your niche
 how do you buy subs
Lets grow together guys
Really helpful
so true there is room for everyone
 uhh hes indian Big advantage there There are  billion indians in india alone all clamoring for ways to get out of poverty There are millions more indians in the US and elsewhere abroad who are constantly seeking ways to increase their standard of living M subscribers could easily be  indians without even making a dent in the overall indian population
Listening to other YouTubers I normally would turn the speed it up 
But listening to Ali I would need to check if I have turned the speed up already 
Very Nice
If you are reading this dont give up on your channel Keep making keep grinding it will Pay off one day

Luv the video so funny the flash clip of eyes rolling about whats going on in their life

Thanks man
Ive wanted to make YouTube videos for the last  years but never got serious about it until relatively recently Wish me luck lol
Thanks for this video  I started my YouTube journey two years ago and crossed kmonth NET profit with two major channels However I do notice lately that all the YouTubers rather keep the real methods to themselves I understood that after reading an eBook No one is talking on how to outrank competitors how to gain additional traffic outside YT how to do proper off site SEO for additional exposure etc
Do you know if its possible to rank with CTR manipulation with real users no bots
 Yes but you will need few people to help approx 
 Can you please share the name of the ebook where you learn all these techniques
 YTalgoexposed
thats the site name as well 
 Big mistakes The more who will know about it the sooner it will stop to work
 This kind of mindset wont get you far Theres enough  for everyone If you are creative enough you can make any saturated method into something new
 I just finished reading this book Couldnt be grateful enough 
Bots lol 
 What ways have you been promoting your channel
Just so yall know this comment along with all the replies is an ad Ive seen this same thread on several videos
Wow how did you start making that crazy Im starting an educational maths channel on YouTube and I really want to be successful
 Daaang I had to read this twice to understand lol  Its well done actually Even the replies
can you please share what you just said No one is talking about how to outrank competitors how to gain additional traffic outside YT how to do proper offsite SEO for additional exposure etc sounds interesting I a yet to start posted two uninspiring videos in y not so up to standard channel 
its true Also Im ayoutuber its very hard to get some subscribers but I dont give up
I love your video 
To all expert youtubers out there I just need help on how to go around youtube tagging my post for age restriction and cannot be monetized I am very nes on youtube I post sexy lady images just like hundreds if youtubers out there Their uploads are actually more provocative than mine But When i check their channels They are all monetized and have thousands of subscribers and thousands of views How cone they can do that and i cant What is the secret What is the settings that i need to adjust or take out 

Advice please Thank you
my fem are you wit me where ya at The Legends on attack
Watching your video in the hope I can make the improvements needed to get  subs and get monetised  love your channel Ali 
This gave me confident about my  subs and  videos especially bc my voice sounds super young even tough im  just like mrbeast ehen he started outbut my solution is no commentary videos lolz

Learn a little bit each day from editing videos on Youtube and then edit a video each day even if its a small sequence of clips and youll look back in  months and be blown away at how much you have progressed and how much easier it is
Love this video

Enjoying the journey and making videos you want to make is really the most important thing Making videos just to get views is going to show making videos you enjoy doing is also  If you dont enjoy it why should others  Keep if fun 
It is certainly a journey but i love being creative and we are in it for the long hall Thank you for your content
I agree
Shay someting what ithis for freeNot only moneyStop layNot work nathingooll ithis money

Hey you said students from Indonesia It is me A student from Indonesia
Just started my channel All the best to all the new creators out there

Hello are you a YouTuber
Thankyou 
Thank you souch ali
Thank you so much for this video Ali
This video seriously adding value
I dreamed about creating youtube videos since I was  I started posting videos  years ago Im  now and dont regret it Its so nice to see comments of other people even though my channel is really small Plus I can already see how much faster I am with the creation process
Your mike is like NOKIA 
Nice
I liked how you separated the process through videos on your channel and the edition of this video is amazing it keeps your attention Im gonna use that as inspo
Great video  good information
GREAT JOB MATE VERY WELL DONE IAM WATCHING FROM AUSTRALIA TIGHT LINES   
I love the calming music in the background and the writing instead of slides thank you
Hey if anyone is truly interested in taking their Youtube channel seriously Id highly suggest having someone to help you draw attention to it by editing the videos in an appealing way If you think this is something you might be considering feel free to shoot over an email for some help
Thank you very much
Good luck everyone  Keep grinding and well all get there 
Yes we will
WOW Thank you for offering so many pieces of advice and for sharing it in a way that I personally connected with Also your lighting and editing is beautiful 
Thank u this was really informative
hir
tbh i started making my own music vids and i always had other people do it for me but learning how to do this has been the best for
me and im saving so much money but the only hard part is promoting because i genuinely jus like doin it and dont care bout the money if that makes sense but this video you broke it down well 
 question how i can make roblox videos on blender
Quality content
Great content subbed Were brand new creators and have found that enjoying the process is equally important as mapping the destination Happy creating yall 
Thanks for the tips
Thank you Ali
To the person who is reading this dont give up on your channel Keep going Its going to pay off in the long run I have hope
I also have hope
Read LOTR to know bout hope 
Feel discourage because of some people who are dear to me said my channel is a bllsht
I dont know if I qualify but I know I can not afford the course So please consider me for one of your scholarships Thank you
nice to watch you i hope this our youtube grow bigger
The algorithm has done it again  Thank you for this video Ali  It showed up at the perfect time for me
Glad it helped
I need this microphone
Hoping this will help my channel Inspiring video 
Great video
maybe I should call my channel NICHE
Youre funny

Such wise points as always my man
Heck yea
This video has the exact title as think media 
some of these are beyond obvious
the critical problem is holding back then theres tons of creativity to spare
I just wanted to drop by and say thank you for sharing such wonderful content Your video was incredibly motivating and the music was a perfect fit I appreciate all the effort you put into creating such amazing videos Looking forward to seeing more from you
If anyone wants music for their channels Im always looking to collab 
The most important thing is taking the first step 
This is soo true
Your videos are so wellmade and you provide great advice Thank you
Consistency is all what you need to start seeing good results 
I try to be consist weekly  I post in the community tab and reply to comments  Sometimes my videos dont get a lot of views
This is a FACT
This is one of the best breakdowns of starting YouTube that I have seen People focus a lot on getting good a thumbnails and riding the trends This is real actionable information Much appreciated
I agree but the thumbnails among others are also equally important People will only click to watch in the first place if the thumbnail is good
A short summary of the video 

Level  Get going get started Start a channel and make  videos to get a feel for the lifestyle before committing to making at least one video a week
Level  Get good enough  Get better at the craft for the next  videos Focus on actively improving your videomaking skills not overthinking your niche
Level  Get smart  Understand the YouTube game Get people to click keep people watching and leave viewers satisfied Identify your target audience and the value you offer them to increase watch time and satisfaction on YouTube Strategize Combine your interests strengths and competitive advantages to create hypotheses about who you can help with your contentAnalyze and understand the market to find your unique edge

Good day and good luck everyone 
Its very interesting that YouTube essentially attracts two types of creators those who are bold and dont mind what others think of them and those who are on the other end of the spectrum extremely shy and introverted and prefer talking to the camera over talking to people
yesss I am the latter lol
U mean everybody 
I think I may have to disagree with your comment sorry  Im not bold and do worry about what others will think but I love talking to people  and I always find people open up to me In fact talking with people is one of my greatest strengths  So I think Im somewhere in the middle
I am the latter
 so negative
Aaaa Im over on the shy end 
I hide my face and make Roblox edits 
Thank you for the advice what is the name of your microphone
Most Important of all
Never give up  and be grateful
Currently I have  subscribers and Im grateful for that
Thanks for these amazing tips Very helpful Im ready
Lots of truth in this I highly recommend Shorts as a way to make your channel grow Been making YouTube content seriously for  months after just being a viewer for years and Ive had some pretty good results Good luck to everyone working towards building a following 
how much do u make rough estimate 
Bro You are already there 
Wow this is teacher David from Thailand I didnt expect to see you here lol Hes right Thanks for your advice
Naw Shorts dont pay anything One long form video can pay you tens of thousands of dollars with  million views Depending on your niche  cpmrpm  That same video in a short will pay you maybe a hundred bucks  Subscribers also dont mean anything after  and youre in the YTPP Its all about views and multiple streams of income on the platform Im making more money with only k subs than others in my niche with k subs 

If all you care about is getting massive amounts of subs for cloute sure make shorts If you care about making money and building a communitymake long form content
Thank you
I agree my friend 
 best of luck to you
 this is your first question you dont start the good way  make it because you love it and then the rest will come

Are yall dumb Hes got a milly with barely over k views on vids That means he bought subs UhHELLLO
 many minutes is long 
 than  min already cosidered long form
Same here bro
Blessings to you too brother all the best lets change the world in a positive way
I have been working on it last  months I made a minestrone of my main channel Dont have a job and Im in this  Today I made a second channel And will try to focus on only one thing
Im trying shorts but it hasnt worked for me yet every day I upload a new short tho Grinding till it works 
Where do you get the videos from Does YouTube not prevent you from posting videos taken from other platforms
Good Luck man
I appreciate
more than a million subscribers in  years crazy respect bruh
Are thai or just a genius
why are you not verified even tho you have a million subs
s helpful information thanks
And thanks David for starting this thread  

I now know 
shorts for growth focus not exclusively
Longform for the rest including revenue after the required subs
But how do I make shorts I dont even know how to record my voice
TYSMM
 wow thanks for advice
s the maximum minutes for shorts and for longform videos
It is so awesome how it works I have been recently uploading shorts and it has amazing results
 can you please share details on YouTube tutorial

What mic is this
Thanks for another great video Ali Could you possibly elaborate on how to post at least once a week in only  hours  Editing and uploading one video and thumbnail takes me  hours recording usually takes about an hour writing the scriptresearching the topic is around  hours doing my makeup and hair takes an hour setting up my light and tripod and set takes like  mins Any tips for doing it all more efficiently would be great Thanks 
couldnt do it if i tried need subscribers oh well
Excellent video Ali  Great stuff
Stop consuming content start creating I told myself this over and over again when I started my first channel
This is such a good video
Has been my dream to become a YouTuber since I was just  watching smosh and pewdiepie lmao  Good luck to all new channels out there
I am also a digital nomad and recently started a YouTube channel I am really debating whether I should go all in with this or not haha I am an economist and have a fulltime job that is pretty demanding Growing a channel organically seems like a big time effort Regret is my biggest fear But enough with rambling thanks for sharing this Ali
Would be interesting to watch as i havent seen many economist channels  Best of luck 
Great content
Woow six years experience you deliver with simple way and you share for free This is an expensive knowledge Big Thanks from Indonesia
I did start a YouTube channel after watching your video  
What mic are you using
If youre going to start up a YouTube channel dont bother telling your audience to like and subscribe Let your content do the talking If its worthy of a subscription and a like then that speaks volumes to the amount of influence your video has on your audience A good video already doesnt need your obnoxious self insert of practically begging to like and subscribe In my opinion I find that to be pointless lacking common sense It doesnt matter if youre using YouTube solely for money NEVER ask for something that may potentially not deserve it 

Thats my advice to those starting a channel Let your efforts do the talking But you can always encourage your audience to comment down below Its always nice to engage with your audience and make them feel as if their presence there isnt just for the sake of watching the video Your audience likes to feel included
Lets see
Question for you I am a small channel now over K subs Started out posting my interests then focused on model railways Have numerous interests what should I do
this is so different from any other YouTube advice video Ive seen in the same genre but something about the way you explain it the relationship analogy and really breaking it down in the number of videos it really helped in stick in my ADHD brain and inspire me a lot more as opposed to other videos who really just hammer down on niche and staying consistent and making high quality content thank you
Great comment
Great video and great tips I read a lot before starting a YouTube channel that now gives me around kmonth and yeah its not easy at all Takes a lot of time for sure I read an eBook that gave me the last push that I needed with some valuable tips for sure Thanks again for a great video
PERFECT
GOOD CHANELL

Thank you for still making these videos theres still people out there wanting to make the leap

Why your video has too much vignette and dull Feels like brightness is down
It takes me years to finally decide  and  create my  YT channel And I need all the encouragement that I can get
I did your course on skillshare to grow my channel Is this course the same thing
Would you recommend to run ads on your first videos or at some point
Love the way the thoughts are laid out  Not allowed to pick

ONLY COMMENT If Your Channel Is Up And Running 
I just started my channeeeelllll 
Such great tips love the fact that you went straight into it   I am still in phase one I need to take my youtube channel more seriously and commint to it
Thank you so much
Becoming a professional Youtuber is a real commitment that requires a lot of work time  effort
Yeah sometimes people underestimated how much hard work it takes
Indian map at    
Thank you so much for this video I also wanted to ask do you have any classes for editing or for how to upload videos to YouTube 
Learn the craft oh how true We started our channel after someone watched an unedited home video For me its learning a new skill and Im loving it All our film and pictures over three years is totally amateur as a personal record of an adventure through a change in life  Now its becoming a story I had no idea how much enjoyment I would get out of the writing and editing process  its creative challenging and immersive I wish everyone success in what they do and youve shown others how to reach levels they probably didnt know they were capable of achieving Hats off to you Ali
Love the breakdown here The YouTube journey is long and painful but hopefully one day itll be worth it
I like it Thanks
My videos are still terrible but i am slowly getting there through just putting more out there and more importantly my confidence has gone through the roof I am also enjoying itThanks Anyway
Love from india 
Whats microphone is this 
Ive published  videos lol
On the hobby to business spectrum where do you land on that spectrum Youre not allowed to pick  Loved this thanks for sharing
  Love this War of Art reference Such an important book for creators  Tim
This video wont age very well if section  is repealed this year Hopefully it wont come to it
Hello can kindly let me know what mic you are using in this video The white usb mic Thanks so much in advance
full of advertising
Great video Start doing now on  Thanks for sharing
This is how But Ill leave you hanging with the last one
Fantastic content Thanks for sharing your insights
Very good thanks
So true about getting started

  uur elke titel op de hoofdpagina van youtube zijn jullie in mijn gedachte aan het lezen 

  uur tm   uur om een simpele zin als deze in te typen 

dat is hoe lang het duurt
thank you so much
Thank you Abidaal Will your course be available in the future without the live calls etc Only with your explanatory videos I really hope so Regards
I love the relationship analogy  So clever and spot on
so heres my plan create  each in a different niche except the main one where eveythinganything is posted One channel for memes one for art one for animations one for animals one or my own niche and the rest to capitalize on the content that works I fluckking love writing and am fascinating by everything as a writerartist and my big prjects are bookscomics then eventually screenplays My problem is that im too creative and i dont show my face cuz my work will be able to speak for itself I dont mind working  hrs daily on it It is my obsession and eventually ill be able to love off these endeavors HAkuan Matata
I started my channel this year and I really appreciate the advice Starting was definitely the biggest hurdle
ada indo coyy
I have been on YouTube seriously for a period of now a year with over  subscribers but this video is so helpful Thank you Ali
On level  right now Really figuring out my edge  Thank you Ali
YouTube Shorts is a great way to get your video reps in Just hit publish
Thank you this vid is very inspiring 
this is brilliant
I started my channel last year and making videos can be both frustrating and motivating at the same time You need to keep going Going forward of creating videos should be the only option and keep learning as you go along with your journey Always think you are just one video away to be successful We can do this
Haha an account that paid for subscribers lol
This always think you are just one video away from being successful works I am in  videos and shorts and am still hoping
You are right but its difficult to remain hopeful every time
I never buy subscribers They come naturally through youtube shorts If you dont know that kind of idea you better work it now
making videos should not be a burden if you enjoy it Do you
You copied Nate
Change the title to how to 

Trust me
This is so inspiring and helpful Thank you Ali
thanks for this video
 KEY LESSONS

Ali  when you was in medical school 
The method of questions that you had used the video about how to rank st in medical school 
You try to memorise the answers while making questions or when you finish the task of questions  you try to revise the questions and answers too
I am not one to comment on videos but the value you bring to the table my lord
Aaahhh love how your brain works making all messy and confusing things so neat and straightforward Thats your superpower


 Whats going on with hands though Latest research suggests it gets better response

Kindly share the specifications of the entire gear shown at timestamp 
What microphone are you using Sounds really good
DAMN IT I was going to pick  between hobby and business and right then Ali said You cant pick  

Ali

How do you do the background animation behind you
My favourite part about the Youtube journey so far has been the skill acquisition I never thought Id fall in love with videography and editing as much as I have To all those on the fence make the jump
me tooo i never edited anything before i started youtube and now its one of my favorite crafts ive ever learned
Same thing happend to me haha
How and were can i learn editing free
 on youtube
For real I love editing I love the feeling when I get to say I made that but one thing that holds me back is thinking Ill never be as good as I wanna be or what I make just isnt good enough or worth itany tips Im sure someone has felt the same way
Please recommend good video editing tutorials
Same YouTube has made me fall in love with editing

 I too feel the same editing the video and publishing it always makes me feel editing could have been better I feel it will take few years to achieve the level we have set ourselves and I believe this feeling make us go long way on our YouTube Journey Wish you good luck 
SameThe more time passes the more I love it despite the discouragement of channel growth
Very true Tough learning process but it is definitely worth it
which editing site is good for beginner I would like to make some travel videos
me too especially making thumbnails

Fully agree well said Joshua
Yes learning skill as I go love it
This I absolutely LOVE editing and I tend to go overboard and use to worry if it is to much but its become my own unique style and it makes me happy
 do you use to edit
 davinci resolve


Non
same
  i would say watch your fav creators n see how there edits are and try to replicate
Am looking forward to this as well 
Am trying my best hope it gose well
Omgme tooI get so excitedI love it
Same 
Just the video I needed as I just started uploading last week Thank you
We need to appreciate this man 
He does real work
I agree  well done and inspiring
How can I find an editor who could help me make better quality videos I cant currently afford to employ someone full time so Im not making the highest quality videos because I work a  and Im a single father to a  year old boy I love
Your tips have helped me stay consistent for the past  months and Im just about to close in to  subscribers This is HUGE for me Thanks 
 subscribers in  months is Great
 Thanks 
Whats your niche
 web development
 do you make those thumbnails and does youtube pay you
 I use photoshop for my thumbnails and yes Im in the youtube partner program so make money from my videos
Love from india  
Is it important to show your face while youtubing
Get smart   
the problem with Ali Abdaal is that every time his videos are about  youtube content then he pitches his own course which costs more than  sometimes  and  of the people would get nothing extra sorry one day you will run out of those who are paying that ridiculous amount
have something for  of people coming soon 
His YouTube channel is his business Thats his job It sure is expensive for some people but I dont think Ive ever seen someone trash his course as not worth it If you are like me and cant afford it his YouTube videos are still super valuable
 Ali when you was in medical school 
The method of questions that you had used the video about how to rank st in medical school
You try to memorise the answers while making questions or when you finish the task of questions  you try to revise the questions and answers too
Get good mmm
Get going okay
Stopping the video to click on the Like button and commenting so the YouTube algorithm knows were satisfied with Alis content 

for sure going to implement these valuable lessons Thank you Ali for inspiring so many people out here   progress every single video

Agreed Sir
Youtube  Medicine
Ive seen the journey youve been on with your book and Im so happy to hear its progressing nicely

I need help guys 
I have an indian accent  maybe due to this  my audience retention is only     at sec mark  

How can i overcome it  Pls give some suggestions 
I am trying my best to catch US accent  but still Thumbnails are good  edits are good  scripts are good
Maybe my accent is causing problem 
Give some feedbacks guys
Seriously speak as you are Your fake accent really sucks broooo
  thats what i think friend Now im gonna record my voice in my original asian accent Thanks for your feedback bro  
 yes I really love our Indian Accent bro
Hey instead of focusing on changing your accent you could try some other things like listing the topics youll be covering in the video and make the topics sound tempting to watch through Im sure that will help more users stick around Good luck
 yes kinda quick intro about the video
I think your videos are great I think Im addition to the intro stuff other people mentioned youd have good luck with the algorithm by adding text maybe with your main points Cheers
  thank you so much for your words  feedback friend  I will try everything that you guys are asking me to apply 
I guess Ive watched too much Ali abdaal I feel like Id seen you talk about everything here already

Great job Im now at level  and its really fun to see how little changes to my videos can improve the viewer experience Its like the  improvement in the way you do things Ali always talks about Good luck my friend

Gud
Much needed video 
Thank you sm
You would teach the ummah Islam  
Love your videos brother 
Wow nice vedio
Thank you so much i needed this 
First comment
Love the tips
First comment
The way to get started is to quit talking and begin doing
Right Practice makes perfect
Special quote
Really few niches you can be on YT by not talking 
 practice makes it BETTER but not perfect as theres no such thing as perfect
Just started my channel may Allah guide all of us to the right path ameen and do what best for us ameen  
True
Good luck everyone  Keep grinding and well all get there 
Ive started its the staying consistent part
Yes  
 spot on Doesnt have to be perfect just get out there and do something
 its both First starting and then genuinely being strong enough to not quit Both are pretty hard But in the end you get the rewards 
My exams in the way tho
In my case stop thinking and start doing 
Thanks for the motivation
To quit watching  wasting time 
Agreed
This is very true I keep overthinking this process 
Ive been making videos and I am still in  sub
So true I was overthinking so much for  years having all the resources to start and when I finaly pulled the trigger the only thing that I regret is wasting my time becouse I could be  years ahead of myself If you are reading this  just go for it I believe in you
Word I spend more time watching how to do something instead of doing it
Yeahat least  video Mr Beast 
 Practice make permanent
i needed this right now thank you bro
Yessir
Zero to Hero
Yessir
I am trying to grow with everyone here Trying to get  by the end of the month Thank you for the inspiration 
True
Action more than words
Your absolutely correct  This is my exact problem Its like Im waiting for it to start its self lmao  funny not funny
FACTS 
This is probably the best advice ever
Easily understand by thinking MacDonald example its about how we prepare and how we deliver and make viewers satisfied 
Learn before your do
 EXPERIENCE IS THE BEST TEACHER
Thats right
Righttt
So true and also to stop over thinking just do it
I agree with you
Ooh youre hard
I agree If it doesnt work out and I realize its not for me at least I tried But Ill never know if I dont just start making videos and putting the content out there to test the waters
I quit
I have the feeling the people shifting to other platforms
Thats the only thing Keep grinding
Iknr I just got everything I need I got  mics interface  sets of headphones lighting k r my ascetics are not all that but it will stay tuned for the video and bare with me

Perhaps Walk the Talk  otherwise if youre video need the talk its hard to do the walk  
I agree with you my friend 
Oh I misread quit talking as quick talking
I agree and I have been overthinking this
 didnt 
your right bro he wasted his time talking
 yep the extremely difficult part Me 
Agreed 
Just do it
Nice
Im doing exactly this And its Not really Working for me 
Can I get your Guys feedbackinput about my videos

vwzgyes it is
 what are the things required to start making YouTube videos 

I need to be showcasing my skills on YouTube 
 Greetings if you possess noteworthy skills Commencing merely requires a Google account and the camera on your phone the intricacies will unfold as you navigate the process
 which other platforms 
I totally agree with you 
Hello sorry are you a YouTuber

Cant be denied
Stop Consumimg Content And Get To Work
I totally agree At the end of the day its not just about how well you edit how innovative you are People need to want to watch you as well
Word
I strongly agree Best advice here
So true
Thats what he said in the beginning
Read the full comment before replying its just based on my personal and thousands of creators experience who got caught just to buy this creators courses on how to be a YouTuber 
Its literally all fuking luck bro coz Im telling you I literally created so much high quality content and not just from my perspective even with good retention and high CTR YouTube stopped promotingpushing the videos and I got less and less views no one can predict yt algorithm coz there are nearly  cr Creators today and were really dont see the dead ones we just see the one who made it through luck and after  months of hardwork and giving so much time to it only simple suggestion I can give is dont think of it do it  just give a try and dont have expectations that you will become some millionaire It could take a year or two to just get monetizedor even more Dont drop out of college or quit any jobwork you are doing just for YouTube coz its not sustainable and you are not sure about your luck though
Im not trying to demotivate you Im just trying to show you a real side of it which we generally dont see also coz success stories are more celebrated than failures
That is definitely the best way to achieve results 
I agree Time to get started
 true but its better late than never Right 
I stopped thinking too much of it I just started ThinkTales last month and Im glad I did
Wise words
st here lol
Kindly suggest windows laptop for PhD students Thanks
Challenge Accepted
